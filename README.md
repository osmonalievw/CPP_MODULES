## 📖 Description

This repository contains solutions for the C++ Modules (00–04) curriculum at **School 42**.
The primary goal of these modules is to transition from procedural programming (C) to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** while strictly adhering to the **C++98 standard**.

Key focuses include memory management, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Starting from Module 02, all classes are designed in the **Orthodox Canonical Form**.

## 📂 Modules Overview

| Module | Topic | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Module 00** | **Introduction to C++** | Namespaces, Classes, Member functions, stdio streams, Initialization lists. |
| **Module 01** | **Memory & Pointers** | Memory allocation (new/delete), References vs Pointers, Switch statement, File I/O. |
| **Module 02** | **Ad-hoc Polymorphism** | Operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF), Fixed-point numbers. |
| **Module 03** | **Inheritance** | Inheritance chains, Access specifiers, Diamond problem (ClapTrap -> ScavTrap/FragTrap). |
| **Module 04** | **Subtype Polymorphism** | Abstract classes, Interfaces, Virtual functions & Destructors, Deep copy. |

## 🛠️ Usage

Each exercise has its own `Makefile`. To run a specific program, navigate to the directory and compile:

```bash
cd cpp04/ex00
make
./animal
